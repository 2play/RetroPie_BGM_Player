# RetroPie_BGM_Player
A simple background music player to implement on RetroPie and Emulation Station based on [this](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/9133/quick-and-easy-guide-for-adding-music-to-emulatonstation-on-retropie-noob-friendly) guide from RetroPie forum.

I made it simpler to install and created an options menu that can be launched from RetroPie menu, where you can change music volume and toggle music (on or off).
Music stop when you play any emulator, and play again when you leave it back to Emulation Station.

Hope you enjoy it.

## Installation
1. `sudo wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naprosnia/RetroPie_BGM_Player/master/install.sh`
2. `sudo chmod 777 install.sh`
3. `sudo bash install.sh`

## Usage
After the installation and the restart, music start playing when Emulation Station launches. During the installation, 6 musics are downloaded for you.
* To change music volume or enable/disable it, go to `Background Music Settings` on RetroPie settings menu.
* You don't like my music?! Easy for you, simply go to your roms folder, and inside you will find a new folder called "music", you can put there the musics you want. Attention, the audio files should be in .mp3 !
